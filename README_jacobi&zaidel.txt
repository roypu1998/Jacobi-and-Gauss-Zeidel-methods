jacobi methods:

Jacobs method - an iterative method to approximate the solution for: Ax = b
       where A is a matrix, b is a vector and x is the vector we aim to approximate.
       It is done so in jacobs method of approximation.
       
       Parameters:
       -----------
       matrix - matrix A.
       vector - vector b.
       tolerance - real number, the maximum error accepted.
       max_iterations - positive integer, the maximum number of iterations the method will perform.
       
       Output/Return:
       --------------
       x - the Nth iteration of the method, N depends on tolerence and max_iterations.
       The method will print the original equation system, each iteration
       and the final iteration - final approximation and error.






zaidel method:

 Gauss-Zaidel method - an iterative method to approximate the solution for: Ax = b
       where A is a matrix, b is a vector and x is the vector we aim to approximate.
       It is done so in gauss-zaidel method of approximation.
       
       Parameters:
       -----------
       matrix - matrix A.
       vector - vector b.
       tolerance - real number, the maximum error accepted.
       max_iterations - positive integer, the maximum number of iterations the method will perform.
       
       Output/Return:
       --------------
       x - the Nth iteration of the method, N depends on tolerence and max_iterations.
       The method will print the original equation system, each iteration
       and the final iteration - final approximation and error.
